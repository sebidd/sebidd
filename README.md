Hello dear Github users,

coding is an ability which in the world of today opens many possibilities to improve different areas of life.
I prefer coding simulations of traffic flow in Java but I also bring a little bit of C++ experience with me.
My nemesis is graphics programming, as I feel quite uncomfortable with JavaFX, Swing or other libraries.
Another enemy of mine is the urge to program everything by myself instead of using already-made toolkits.
Let us hope that my future-self with handle these errors!

Regards and a bug-free time,

Sebastian
